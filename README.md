# Stealth Game Prototype
A 2D stealth game prototype in Unity

I plan on making a stealth game, so I decided to start with a prototype to see what I'm capable of. This is essentially an exercise in scripting, and will only consist of placeholder assets (unless I manage to get an artist on board).

## Installation

Clone repository and open the project folder. There's no build at the time of writing.

## License

GPLv2 because why not
